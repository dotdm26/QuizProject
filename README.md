# QuizProject

This is a console log quiz game written in C++. It is designed to be customizable by the player.

The player is prompted to pick the right answer for 5 questions, each one giving 3 different options.

The player is encouraged to add their own questions into the program, which will be saved into a separate questions.txt file that serves as the data file.
