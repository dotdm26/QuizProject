# QuizProject

This is a console log quiz game written in C++. It is designed to be customizable by the player.

The program imports questions from a questions.txt file. It is possible to add questions into the program, directly into the .txt file or clear them all. 

Each of the questions come with 4 answers. In the game, 3 answers will be randomly selected, and only one of them is the correct answer.
